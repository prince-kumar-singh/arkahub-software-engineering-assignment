# EnergyGrid Client Solution

This folder contains the source code for the EnergyGrid Client.

For full implementation details, design, and logic, please refer to the [Root README](../README.md).

## Quick Start (Client Only)

If you strictly want to run just the client (assuming the mock server is already up):

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```
